The Novice Chef homepage has a search field in the centre with two buttons below it, 'Search' and 'Pick For Me'. The user can type key words into the search field and click the 'Search' button to find results which are provided by the mealdb API. Once clicked the user is taken to a new page where their relevant search results are presented in a list. When the user clicks on a result they are taken to that results recepie page.
On the recepie page the user is presented with a list of required ingredients, instructions on how to cook the meal, pictures of the meal and a video on how to cook the meal provided by the youtube API. If on the homepage the user decides to click the 'Pick For Me' button instead, they are taken to a random recepie page that is structured identically to the other recepie pages the user can access.
