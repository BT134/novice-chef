# Novice Chef - Group Project

## Desciption

> Don't know what you want for dinner? Searching for a recipe? Feel like something different? Novice Chef is here to help! This web app allows you to search for a recipe with either the recipe name or main ingredient. It will then display a list of recipes matching your search field and then you can click on your prefered option and you will be taken to the recipe. 

> The Novice Chef homepage has a search field in the centre with two buttons below it, 'Search' and 'Pick For Me'. There are engaging quotes above the search field encouraging the user to search for a meal. The user can type key words into the search field and click the 'Search' button to find results which are provided by the mealdb API. Once clicked the user is taken to the results page, in the header 'Novice Chef' is on the left , a search again field to the centre/right and two buttons on the right, 'Search' and 'Home'. In the body the relevant search results are presented in a list with the meals name on the left and a large picture of the meal shown on the right. When the user clicks on either the meals name or picture they are taken to that meals recepie page.

> In the recipe pages header 'Recipe' can be seen on the left and 'Home' on the right. When 'Home' is clicked the user is taken to the home page. In the body the user is presented with a list of required ingredients on the left, a large picture of the meal on the right, cooking instructions underneath them and a video on how to cook the meal provided by the youtube API below the cooking instructions. When on the homepage, if the user decides to click the 'Pick For Me' button instead, they are taken to a random recepie page that is structured identically to the other recipe page.

## User Story:
